	a well designed DSL can be understandable by business people,allowing them to directly comprehend the code
	
6. Internal DSL just use the regular facilities of the programming language that you are using anyway
7. External DSL require you to use some special tools

8. DSL allow business people and developers to collaborate more effectively buecause they can  talk about a common set of precise rules that are the executable code
9. When should i consider making a DSL?
